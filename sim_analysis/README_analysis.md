# Analysis (Computational Model of the Whisker Thalamocortical Pathway)

## Description
Detailed computational model of the whisker thalamocortical pathway of the mouse developed in NetPyNE ([www.netpyne.org](https://www.netpyne.org/)).

The model is described in the following publication:

- Moreira JVS, Borges FS, Atherton Z, Crandall S, Varela C, Dura-Bernal S (2025) TITLE. JOURNAL.


## Setup and execution

This code can be used to reproduce the analysis and figures in the paper. It requires having access to the data generated by the model.  
The experimental data shown in the figures was extracted from the cited papers and is included in the analysis scripts.

The file **run_analysis.sh** contains the Python source code to generate the results in all the paper figures.  
It makes use of several other Python files in the analysis folder.  
To run all analysis, use the following command:  
- `./run_analysis.sh`

Otherwise, run each individual file separately:  
- e.g. `python analyze_fig02_sleep_wake_PSD.py`
